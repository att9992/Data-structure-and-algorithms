For the union and intersection problem, the linked lists are transformed to lists and then combining with sets to done the work.
Union: we find the creation of the final array, again O(n), making n*O(n) be resulting to O(n)
Intersection: we find the creation of the final array, which is a double for-loop, resulting finally in O(n^2)
