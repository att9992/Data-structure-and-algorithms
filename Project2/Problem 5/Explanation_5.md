My implementation includes a class named Blockchain. There are several methods I added,including add_block which updates the block,search and size
The time complexity of add_block is O(1). Reason: The function occurs in constant time.
The space complexity of add_block is O(1). Reason: The function allocates a single variable every time.
The time complexity of search and size is O(n). 
The space complexity of search and size is O(n).
